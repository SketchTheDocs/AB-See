      <description>What is the ABSee project?
 #ABSee is a @SketchTheDocs project that uses visual puzzles to build your tech IQ around concepts, products and people. It&amp;rsquo;s an experiment in game-based learning that airs as a weekly 5-minute segment on Hello World live.
  This is the same figure as the banner, but with alt-text added for accessibility.
  How does it work?
    Want to see the concept in action?</description>

      <description>Hello World is a live 30-min news &amp;amp; edutainment show broadcast weekdays on Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Learn TV. The A-B-See segment is a regular feature on the Thursday edition of the show, where I serve a dual role - as co-host (for the show) and producer (for the segment).
You can find the show episodes along with show notes and other resources, on Channel 9 at https://aka.ms/helloworld. This site provides offsets for each segment - so if you have a favorite segment (cough ABSee *cough) you can zoom straight to that part of the show to catch up.</description>
