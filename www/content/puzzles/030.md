## 1. Study The Clue
 
We can learn a few things. First, it's a `concept` - so it must be some familiar technology term. We know it has three words - and the last two are `design pattern`. That makes things easier. What design pattern involves two components, where one `takes care of the primary application needs` and the other `takes care of the peripheral tasks`? The bonus clue indicates `a 4-letter product was launched recently` that embodies this pattern!

## 2. Watch The Timelapse
 
Why? Because it's fun - and you can process the information a bit at a time. Pay attention to other visual cues that you might notice - like the blue hat on the passenger, and the fact that the driver looks like a mobile phone.
