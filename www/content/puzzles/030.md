## The Hints: _Study the image_

We can observe a few things:

    * We're looking for a service - so it's a product name.
    * The answer has 3 words (5-4-5 characters)
    * It has something to do with "GPT-3"
    * It involves a technnology for building apps - but it uses formulas.
    * Ah! It mentions Power Fx (formulas) - so this must relate to Power Apps.
    * And this hint: "These ideas!"

We can guess that the answer is probably "Power Apps -----" and all we need to figure out is the last part, which has something to do with natural language and GPT-3.
