> What is the ABSee project?

#ABSee is a @SketchTheDocs project that uses visual puzzles to build your tech IQ around concepts, products and people. It's an experiment in game-based learning that airs as a weekly 5-minute segment on [Hello World](https://aka.ms/helloworld) live.

It also describes the ABSee game in 2 steps: SHOW (where we visualize a technology or concept) and TELL (where you try to guess what we are talking about from the visual hints)" >}}
