[Hello World](https://aka.ms/helloworld) is a live 30-min news & edutainment show broadcast weekdays on Microsoft's [Learn TV](https://aka.ms/learntv). The _A-B-See_ segment is a regular feature on the Thursday edition of the show, where I serve a dual role - as co-host (for the show) and producer (for the segment).

You can find the show episodes along with show notes and other resources, on Channel 9 at [https://aka.ms/helloworld](https://aka.ms/helloworld). This site provides offsets for each segment - so if you have a favorite segment (*cough* ABSee *cough) you can zoom straight to that part of the show to catch up. You can also watch the videos [here, on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHjy-ZOytBZVD1EQpVBKvlaQ) - but don't get those added resources.

Want to watch the show live? Tune in weekdays at 1:30pm-2:30pm EST on LearnTV - and use the built-in chat interface to answer questions, or provide feedback!

But wait - want to just catch up with the conversation on the go? The Hello World audio track for each episode is available as a podcast on the [Apple Podcasts site](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hello-world/id1558697248) - while you may not be able to see the visual clues for ABSee, you can definitely catch up with the news and discussions from the guests - and follow up later to watch video from the key segments of interest.

The ABSee segment debuted on Hello World on March 25, 2021. Learn more about it's history, motivation, and process by visiting my ["About: ABSee"](/about) page.
