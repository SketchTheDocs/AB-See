# The A-B-See Project

A-B-See is a project in the `SketchTheDocs` family that explores the intersection of visual and game-based learning.

The broader focus is on *using visual storytelling to teach technology concepts or processes* in ways that  cater to visual learning styles. Learn more at [sketchthedocs.dev](https://sketchthedocs.dev) and follow [@SketchTheDocs](https://twitter.com/sketchthedocs) for news and updates.

## A-B-See History

A-B-See launched in April 2021 as a 5-minute segment on the Thursday edition of [HelloWorld](https://aka.ms/helloworld), a daily show broadcast live on [Microsoft LearnTV](https://aka.ms/learntv). It was the result of a brainstorming session into ideas that could make the show more interactive for viewers.

The concept is simple. Given a technology term or phrase, I visualize a tech term of phrase (for a concept, person or product) in under 30 seconds. Our guests (and viewers) try to guess what it is from the visual hints I provide. And hopefully, they always remember that term and its meaning or context, later.


`üéâ MILESTONE ALERT`

On Jun 3, 2021 - I debuted [the 30th puzzle](http://aka.ms/helloworld) in the series, an awesome milestone! You can [watch that segment here](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Hello-World/Hello-World-Thursday-June-3-2021#time=19m30s) to get a sense of how the game is played.

`üóì JOIN US`

A-B-See airs live on #HelloWorldLive Thursdays @1:30pm EST on [LearnTV](https://aka.ms/learntv). Come puzzle it out and build your tech IQ.

## Website

Creating puzzles is both rewarding and challenging, and I've often been asked to explain my process. *This* blog is the result of that request.

Think of this blog as a puzzle archive where the main page shows just the puzzles (so you can try to guess the answers yourself first). Click on any tile to get to a detailed page that provides the following information:

 * `What` | Describes various hints in the puzzle.
 * `Why` | Explains why I chose this topic or clue format.
 * `How` | Shows 30s time-lapse replay of drawing it.
 * `Where` | Points you to related resources for learning.
 * `Watch` | Link to the show where this was solved.

## Motivation

TL;DR:
_We all learn differently. This is a project to support visual and game-based learning styles to teach basic tech terminology in fun ways._

The longer story:

The [SketchTheDocs](https://twitter.com/sketchthedocs) initiative began in Feb 2021 - but the groundwork had been laid for years based on my own personal process for learning, and teaching, tech concepts. The goal was to explore `visual storytelling` ideas to make complex technology concepts or workflows _easier to understand and recall_. To me, visual storytelling is about using visual elements (illustrations, colors, layouts, hierarchies and metaphors) to augment or supplement our learning documentation and tutorials.

We learn best when the learning materials have visual stimuli integrated in them. We use those illustrations to create _mental pictures_ for ourselves, helping us understand and remember those concepts better.

We also rely heavily on our sight to absorb and process information. Our brains are wired to look for patterns, connect them to familiar concepts - and help us transfer our knowledge or reinforce our understanding.

> DID YOU KNOW: <br/> 
[One third of students](https://nyctd.org/classDetail.cfm) are [visual-spatial learners](https://www.verywellfamily.com/understanding-visual-spatial-learning-styles-2162778).

We don't just learn from visuals, we *think* in pictures. We like to see _the big picture_ and process information holistically before we dive into the details. I think of it like _reverse engineering_, where I learn better by seeing the end product then taking it apart to look under the hood.

By contrast, traditional learning emphasizes [sequential learners](https://www.dyslexia.com/about-dyslexia/dyslexic-talents/the-visual-spatial-learner/) - teaching concepts starting from scratch and going step-by-step till you get to the big picture. This works best for those who think linearly, and like to build things up, rather than deconstruct them, to learn the fundamentals.


> DID YOU KNOW: <br/> 
Game-based learning (e.g., [puzzle-based learning](http://www.puzzlebasedlearning.edu.au/what-is-puzzle-based-learning/)) can build critical thinking muscles that enhance understanding?

These are methodologies for teaching ideas in a manner that encourages _exploration_ and critical thinking, rather than _instruction_ and rote learning. For A-B-See I was inspired by [Rebus puzzles](https://gpuzzles.com/quiz/rebus-picture-brain-teasers-puzzles-answers/)  and [visual puns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_pun) as mechanisms that engage learners, making concepts fun while also improving your [memory and cognitive understanding](https://k12teacherstaffdevelopment.com/tlb/use-brain-teasers-in-the-classroom-to-make-learning-fun-and-exciting/) of the topic of focus.

The objective in A-B-See is to create a `visual glossary` for technology terms and phrases related to relevant products, core concepts, and people. But, instead of _telling_ you what something means, I _illustrate_ my perspective with examples or metaphors. This now lets you make your own connections in ways that help personalize your understanding and solidify your recall.
